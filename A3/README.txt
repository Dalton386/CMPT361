******************************************
This ray tracing program achieve all 7 required features. It is free to test with all possible legal arguments.

NOTE:
1. in default scene, all spheres are opaque, whereas they are transparent in user-define mode;
2. in both [-d | -u] modes, you can add a chess board below all spheres by indicating "+c" in arguments list;
3. since stochastic ray generation leads to huge computational cost increments, it is suggested not to set step_max more than 3 when "+f" enabled;
4. the chess board is always shiny but opaque;
